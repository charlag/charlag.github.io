                The big part of me is making things. I rarely can spend few days
                 without trying out some idea or new technology. At the same time
                 I really like deeply focusing on one project but I am still looking
                 for one that will be useful for people. If you have an idea or
                 a project - don't hesitate to text me.

                I prefer to learn things myself but I love to have a mentor which
                I can bother. I never have one so I learn things myself.

                Despite the fact that I was born in Russia I don't identify myself
                as a typical Russian nor I share values of most russians. I prefer
                Finnish, German and some other Nordic cultures which pursue
                rationalism, equality and humbleness.

                I strongly belive that our methods of software development will
                change soon because of the 'exponential hangover' and that we
                should find reliable ways to use parallelism. I see functional
                programming as one of the solutions for the future problems.
